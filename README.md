Description.

I have more than 20 years of experience. However, my background is around leading projects as a Product Owner. For that reason, I've been looking for a structured information portfolio that allows me to expand all my background in different branches of knowledge and experience.

As long as I am shaping up to a new profile, I am focusing on web development. Consequently, I develop my site using bootstrap, flexbox and grids to evidence my knowledge in those concepts.

Challeneges

I wish I knew to develop my navigation system with Js because I did a charming navigation bar according to my original design. I had to give up some "nice to have" features and focus on the principal elements and requirements. I hope to keep learning techniques and strategies that allow me to remove techincal barriers and improve the user experience in my projects.

Learning.

In addition to strengthening basic concepts, I learned:

- How is important the layout and reutilizable components, because it allowed to coding simple and clean.
- I could combine bootstrap with grids and flexbox.
- I did some enhacements with responsiveness for fonts and images.
- I learned how is important the prototype to make your flow and process faster.

Used Assets.

- CSS Framework: Bootstrap 5 Libraries
- Images: Taken from Unsplash
- Google Family Fonts: Roboto & Nunito
- Reset CSS: Meyer Web.
