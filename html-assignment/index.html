      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <!-- Main Idea -->
      <p>
        My vocation is a balance between <strong>design</strong> and
        <strong>technology</strong>. However, the circumstances have gradually
        taken me to other fields of knowledge during my job experience. Despite
        that, I always showed a genuine interest in designing digital
        experiences. Consequently, I decided to <i> raise the pencil</i> again
        and continue with the self portrait that I began 20 years ago.
      </p>
      <!-- Explanation -->
      <p>
        Now that I have taken this decision, I have three expectations with the
        <em> <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMM</abbr> program.</em> The
        <b> first one </b> is to lose the fear of writing code; the
        <b> second one </b> is to recover hard design skills, and the
        <b> last one </b> is improve my technical English. I am sure I took the
        right path with <strong> Algonquin Collegue </strong> to achieve my
        purpose.
