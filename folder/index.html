    <h1>About Me / FOLDER / INDEX FOLDER</h1>
    <br />
    <p>
      My vocation is a balance between <strong>design</strong> and
      <strong>technology</strong>. However, the circumstances have gradually
      taken me to other fields of knowledge during my job experience. Despite
      that, I always showed a genuine interest in designing digital experiences.
      Consequently, I decided to <i> raise the pencil</i> again and continue
      with the self portrait that I began 20 years ago.
